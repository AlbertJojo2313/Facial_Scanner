This project is a Python-based facial recognition system that allows you to train a model on a dataset of known faces, validate the model's accuracy, and recognize faces in unknown images. It uses the face_recognition library and provides command-line options for training, validation, and testing the model. The recognized faces are highlighted with bounding boxes and labeled with their names in a graphical user interface.
