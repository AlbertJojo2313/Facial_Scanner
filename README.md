To use the project:

    To train the model, use the --train flag and specify the model type with the -m flag ("hog" or "cnn"). The trained encodings will be saved in a file.

    To validate the model, use the --validate flag and specify the model type with the -m flag. This will display recognized faces in validation images.

    To test the model with an unknown image, use the --test flag and provide the path to the image with unknown faces using the -f flag.
